This is a [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org) implementation of a readonly
[WebDAV](https://webdav.org) interface to [DANDI
Archive](https://dandiarchive.org).

An active instance is currently accessible at
<https://dandi.centerforopenneuroscience.org>.

Features
========

- Support for readonly operations from [RFC
  4918](http://www.webdav.org/specs/rfc4918.html), [DAV compliance
  classes](http://www.webdav.org/specs/rfc4918.html#dav.compliance.classes) 1
  and 3.
    - Not supported: Locking, mutating requests

- `GET` requests for collection resources are replied to with HTML tables of
  the collections' entries

- `GET` requests for non-collection resources are replied to with 307 redirects
  to S3

    - Note that HTML pages for collections link blob assets & Zarr entries
      directly to download URLs rather than to URLs served by `dandidav`, but
      this is just to save on a request; if you directly access, say,
      <http://localhost:8080/dandisets/000027/draft/sub-RAT123/sub-RAT123.nwb>,
      either by editing the browser address bar or via the command line, you
      will see the redirect.

    - Note that redirects for blob assets first go to Archive API `/download`
      URLs, which redirect again to S3.  This is necessary in order to obtain a
      signed S3 URL that specifies the download file name so that downloaded
      asset blobs will be given the file name of their asset instead of the
      blob ID.

        - This can be changed via the `--prefer-s3-redirects` command-line
          option.

- Hierarchies served:

    - `/dandisets/`: A view of Dandisets & assets (including Zarr entries, and
      including version metadata as virtual `dandiset.yaml` files) in Dandi
      Archive, retrieved via the Dandi Archive and S3 APIs

    - `/zarrs/`: A view of all Zarrs in the Dandi Archive at various points in
      time, as recorded by/at <https://github.com/dandi/zarr-manifests>


Building & Running
==================

1. [Install Rust and Cargo](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install).

2. Clone this repository and `cd` into it.

3. Run `cargo build` to build the binary.  The intermediate build artifacts
   will be cached in `target/` in order to speed up subsequent builds.

    - Alternatively, run `cargo build --release` or `cargo build -r` to build
      with optimizations enabled.

4. Run with `cargo run` (or `cargo run --release` if built with `--release`) to
   run the server.  If any server CLI options (see below) are supplied, they
   must be separated from `cargo run [--release]` by a `--` argument.

    - The WebDAV server will be accessible for as long as the program is left
      running.  Shut it down by hitting Ctrl-C.

5. If necessary, the actual binary can be found in `target/debug/dandidav` (or
   `target/release/dandidav` if built with `--release`).  It should run on any
   system with the same OS and architecture as it was built on.


Usage
=====

    cargo run [-r] -- [<options>]

`dandidav` serves an HTTP & WebDAV interface at http://127.0.0.1:8080 by
default.  It can be accessed by any WebDAV client or in a normal web browser.
(If your client asks you about login details, you may log in without
authentication/as a guest.)

Options
-------

- `--api-url <URL>` — Specify the API URL of the DANDI Archive instance to
  serve [default: `https://api.dandiarchive.org/api`]

- `--ip-addr <IPADDR>` — Specify the IP address for the server to listen on
  [default: 127.0.0.1]

- `-p <PORT>`, `--port <PORT>` — Specify the port for the server to listen on
  [default: 8080]

- `--prefer-s3-redirects` — Redirect requests for blob assets directly to S3
  instead of to Archive URLs that redirect to signed S3 URLs.

    Note that this only affects `GET` requests made directly to blob assets.
    Links to blob assets in the web view will continue to point to Archive
    URLs.

- `-T <TITLE>`, `--title <TITLE>` — Specify the site name to use in HTML/web
  views of collections (used inside `<title>`'s and as the root breadcrumb
  text) [default: dandidav]
